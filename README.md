# Car Clustering Analysis

This project performs a clustering analysis on a dataset of cars using the K-means clustering algorithm. The main objectives of the project are to preprocess the dataset, explore relationships between variables, apply clustering, and analyze the resulting clusters.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/shahzaibjanjua25/Vehicle-Clustering-Analysis
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Python script file named `car_clustering.py`.
2. Modify the file path `url` to point to the location of the `cars_clus.csv` dataset file on your local machine.
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python oel.py
   ```

The script will perform the following tasks:

1. Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize the correlation matrix.
3. Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
4. Apply K-means clustering and calculate the Silhouette score.
5. Save the clustered data into separate CSV files for each cluster.
6. Plot a scatter plot showing the relationship between MPG and Price, colored by clusters.
7. Print the vehicles in each cluster.

## Results

The script will provide descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and cluster visualization. It will also save individual CSV files for each cluster and display a scatter plot showing the relationship between MPG and Price.
